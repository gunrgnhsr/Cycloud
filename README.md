**Resource Exchange Server**

This server is designed to facilitate the exchange of computing resources between Suppliers and Users. Suppliers can offer their spare computing power to Users, who can then use it for their own needs.

**How it works**

1. **Registration:** Users and Suppliers register with the server, providing their contact information and resource availability.
2. **Bidding:** Users submit bids for the resources they need, specifying the amount of resources and the price they are willing to pay.
3. **Matching:** The server matches bids with available resources, taking into account the price and the operating costs of the Suppliers.
4. **Exchange:** Once a match is made, the server connects the Supplier and User and allows them to exchange resources directly.

**Features**

* **Secure communication:** All communication between the server and clients is encrypted using HTTPS.
* **Authentication and authorization:** Users and Suppliers are authenticated using JWT tokens, which ensures that only authorized users can access resources.
* **Flexible resource types:** The server supports a variety of resource types, including CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth.
* **Fair pricing:** The bidding system ensures that Users pay a fair price for the resources they use, taking into account the operating costs of the Suppliers.
* **Easy to use:** The server provides a simple web-based interface for both Users and Suppliers.

**Installation**
